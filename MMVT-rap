A brief description of MMVT in the form of a rap song, written by ChatGPT:

Verse 1:
MMVT is a tool that we use to analyze
Multimodal brain imaging data, no lies
Structural MRI, diffusion MRI
Functional MRI, we see it all clearly

Chorus:
MMVT, MMVT
Analyzing brain data, that's what it's meant
To identify patterns, to see what's going on
In the brain, it's a tool that can't go wrong

Verse 2:
With MMVT, we can visualize the brain
At multiple scales, we don't feel the pain
We see the anatomy, the connectivity
The activity patterns, we see it all clearly

Chorus:
MMVT, MMVT
Analyzing brain data, that's what it's meant
To identify patterns, to see what's going on
In the brain, it's a tool that can't go wrong

Verse 3:
For epilepsy surgical planning, it's a must
To understand brain dynamics, we need to trust
MMVT, to help us identify
The sources of abnormal activity, we can't deny

Chorus:
MMVT, MMVT
Analyzing brain data, that's what it's meant
To identify patterns, to see what's going on
In the brain, it's a tool that can't go wrong
